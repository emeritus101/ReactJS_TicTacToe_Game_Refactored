# The Tic Tac Toe game Refactored

![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/emeritus101/ReactJS_TicTacToe_Game_Refactored/blob/main/SampleExerciseRefactoring.JPG)

## Description: 
Using the sample code from the MIT xPRO MERN Course, I am applying some refactoring to the Tic Tac Toe project from the last weeks. 

I have made the following modifications:

1. links for the page navigation: on how to play the game and for contact information
2. a Bootstrap link for styling
3. navigation bar on top with links to 3 pages: how to play the game, about the history of the game, and about the webpage.

## How to play:
1. Click and any cell in the square to start playing. The first player will always start with X.
2. The first player getting 3 letter across a diagonal wins.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
1. Adding background and more user interaction
2. Adding more text and links to the about, history and how-to-play pages
3. Find some more icons to include in the game instead of using the "X" and "0".
4. Add "Back to top" link to go to top of the page
